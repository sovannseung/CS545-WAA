In this course, we will explore the principles of a well-designed Enterprise Web Application using an N-tier Architecture. The majority of enterprise software applications are built in this way: as an N-tier application. You will learn that a well-designed N-tier application follows good software architecture principles.

The Spring Framework is the technology that we will use to investigate the concepts of a Web Application Architecture.

Also, in an Enterpriseâ€“level work environment, professional success is highly correlated with the ability to work in a team environment. In this course, we will develop team skills by organizing into groups of 3 or 4 at the start of the course. Teams will work as a unit, discussing course material, collaborating on labs and developing the course project.
